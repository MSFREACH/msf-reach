[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MSFREACH/msf-reach/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/MSFREACH/msf-reach?branch=master)

### Dependencies
- see package.json, or run
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Local environment
For running locally, make sure you have a .env file with any overrides for src/config.js, and also update [public/resources/js/events.js#L9](https://github.com/MSFREACH/msf-reach/blob/master/public/resources/js/events.js#L9) to your localhost (and port number as per config). Use of cognito for authentication is disabled by default to make local testing easier (but enabled for our hosted environment).

### Environment variables
#### Login
If using Cognito: Set AWS_COGNITO_ALGORITHM to 'RS256', and AWS_COGNITO_PEM to the public key incl. line breaksâ€”on AWS ElasticBeanstalk where line breaks are not supported in environment variables you need to replace new lines with commas when entering the environment variable, which will be converted back to line breaks in the code.

If using Active Directory: Set the AZURE_AD_* variables with values supplied by AD operator.

Either way, set AUTH=true to force users to login (otherwise if false it will bypass login for local test and development)

#### Other environment variables:
* ARCGIS_TOKEN: obtain from https://arcgis.cartong.org/arcgis/tokens/generateToken by using username, password, setting expiry for one year, and referrer https://(environment.)msf-reach.org/
* APP_NAME: leave this as default 'msf-reach'. Only used for logging.

* BODY_LIMIT: defaults to 100kb for upload post/put body data (but not file uploads)

* COMPRESS: true / false for gzip compression

* PORT: TCP port to run on (omit to use default of 8001 for Elastic Beanstalk)
* BASE_URL: base URL eg. https://msf-reach.org/ , if ommited defaults to 'http://localhost:8001/',
